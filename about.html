       <p>Hello! I'm Disha Mahajan, a Computer Science Engineering student with a deep passion for web development and design.</p>

       <p>My journey into tech began with curiosity â€” how do websites actually work? That curiosity soon turned into a love for coding. Starting with HTML and CSS, I found joy in turning structure into beautiful, responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid.</p>

        <p>Over time, I've moved beyond just styling â€” I'm currently diving into Python and SQL, and soon into Flask for backend development. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer who can build everything from front-facing interfaces to data-driven systems.</p>

       <p>What makes me excited about development is not just writing code, but solving real-world problems with it. Whether it's designing an intuitive user experience or writing clean, maintainable logic, I believe good developers blend logic with creativity.</p>

       <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy learning about UI/UX, writing notes to explain things to others, and refining my digital workspace (yes, I'm that person who color-codes their folders ðŸ¤“). I love working on personal projects that challenge me to grow with each line of code.</p>

      <p>I may be early in my journey, but I bring dedication, hunger to learn, and a mindset thats not afraid to start from scratch.</p>
      <p>If you're reading this â€” thank you for being part of that journey. ðŸ’»âœ¨</p>
